    <p>Amazing and cute joint. This place was by far one of our favorites. The cafe itself had nice vibes; the area around it was great for walking around and viewing the cascading Charles River.

    <h2>Ethiopian Yirgacheffe</h2>
    <p>I've never had Yirgacheffe before, but I definitely enjoyed the experience. I ordered it black; I could definitely note the fruity and floral notes hidden behind the bitter and sour mask. Overall, definitely a positive experience: 8.1/10
