    <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
    <p>“Warm” is the word I'd give it. The flavor profile was so “coffee”—rich, warm, nutty, and bitter but in the most positive way possible. This one's definitely one of our favorite spots. We missed out on their specials menu, but their classics did not disappoint. The cappuccino itself was a solid 9.1/10.

    <h2>Mocha</h2>
    <p>This mocha had a unique taste, with the rich chocolate notes complementing the fruity coffee, resulting in a near-perfect blend of flavors. 9.5/10
